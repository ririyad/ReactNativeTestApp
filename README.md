## Sample Project on React Native

This is a sample project based on [create-react-native](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

As I am still new to learn React native, I need to see the following topic in detail:
- React Basics
  - JSX
  - components (component life cycle)
  - state
    - [have a clear idea how **setState** works](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)
  - props
- Flexbox

### Useful info
