## Sample Project on React Native

This is a sample project based on [create-react-native](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

As I am still new to learn React native, I need to see the following topic in detail:
- React Basics
  - JSX
  - components (component life cycle)
  - state
  - props
- Flexbox

### Useful info
---

- [Information of upgrading to the new React Native version](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html)
- [Version support information](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/VERSIONS.md)

### Task
------

- [ ] As current **create-react-native** app version is 0.54 which is behind the react-native version (0.55) now, it is recommeded to build a project from scratch based on the latest react-native
